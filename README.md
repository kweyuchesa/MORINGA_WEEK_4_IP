# WEEK-4---MORINGA-IP
In this week's independent project, you will be working as a data scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company. You have been tasked to process stations data to understand electric car usage over time by solving for the following research question; 

RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 
 
      Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of 
      Paris over the month of April 2018
      What is the most popular hour for returning cars?
      What station is the most popular?
      Overall?
      At the most popular picking hour?
      What postal code is the most popular for picking up Bluecars? Does the most popular station belong to that postal code?
      Overall?
      At the most popular picking hour?
      Do the results change if you consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Bluecars? (that could be asked earlier to 
      push students to write modular code that can be used to query different things)
      Your final deliverable will be a data report which will comprise the following sections;

DATA REPORT STRUCTURE

    Business Understanding 
    Data Understanding 
    Data Preparation 
    Analysis 
    Recommendation 
    Evaluation

TASK ONE:
 
  Write Code in Python to input the data, Clean it, use it to analyse and answer the questions. 
  
TASK 2:

  Push the code in GitHub 
  
TASK 3: 

  Prepare a Data Report in Word and share with TM.
